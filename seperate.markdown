# seperate all the concerns

making a piece
a feature set,
reset the server
too complicated

new features
are complications
by any other name

seperate all the conerns

# your commit message sucks

this pull request, unimpressed
what the fuck is this shit

commit binary diff
this is not subversion

these commits make it faster
but it's a code disaster

you didn't even measure
what a fucking pleasure

you reindented all the files
I rewrote it in coffee script
it's more readable now
