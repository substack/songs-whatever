even if you lay out the facts
well some people just don't listen

Like euthyphro, like piety,
Like what makes good can't be decided by society
I mean vote is just an appeal to the majority
authority is similarly suspect

like to a book or a priest
see, here is the 
and here is the steeple
shut down the doors and open up the people

self-impoverished
poverty
thirty


I care too much about is true
the truth doesn't care what you believe
so do take offence
it's just indifference


pursuit for truth

you might not like what you find but


well that's cool

Move to the meat of the argument

But I stopped eating meat because I can't well defend it
Or pretend that necessarily it's required
Or that secondarily,
All else being equal,
Desire trumps convenience.
But the ethical consistency is smooth, I recommend it.

So I steal a snack from the garden Eden
So pardon, me, not climbing up a knowledge tree here, nope
Just a relatively gentle slope
Rolling uphill to the focal, the local with the newton
Snatch up that low-hanging fruit, done.

Okay but what now I could get stuck
diminishing returns

And excuse me as I'm making it up as I go so play along
This song, it's not long
But what the fuck do I know about lyric
Knowing nothing


unaffiliated


what the evidence is saying you're best to oblige it
apply it

interrogate it
epistemic optimism


because of demons
because of humours

because of phlogiston, I guess
the teacher's password


in my day job and as a hobby I tell the computer what to
do you think

like any other skill it's just a silly bag of tricks,
which is why I've got a record of scratching my own itch

refine
